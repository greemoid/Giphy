# Giphy

The Gifi app allows you to watch gifs offered by the api itself and search for gifs by keyword. 

When you turn on the application, it checks for an internet connection. The application does not crash when the Internet is turned off. The application supports light and dark themes, changes the color scheme. The app supports configuration changes, such as rotating the screen. It uses MVVM pattern, depedency injection (Koin), is completely written in kotlin, long processes are moved to other threads using coroutines, all development is done in github and development stages can be watched in the develop branch.



The technology and instruments stack I used in developing the application 
- Kotlin
- Retrofit
- MVVM
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Coroutines
- Jetpack Navigation
- Android Architecture Components
- Glide
- Hilt
- ViewBinding
- Github
- KanbanFlow

Before I started development, I wrote a user story, test cases, application architecture, and made a plan in Kanbanflow. You can see it at the link:
